DiffPDF
===========

DiffPDF is used to compare two PDF files. By default the comparison is
of the text on each pair of pages, but comparing the appearance of pages
is also supported (for example, if a diagram is changed or a paragraph
reformatted). It is also possible to compare particular pages or page
ranges. For example, if there are two versions of a PDF file, one with
pages 1-12 and the other with pages 1-13 because of an extra page having
been added as page 4, they can be compared by specifying two page
ranges, 1-12 for the first and 1-3, 5-13 for the second. This will make
DiffPDF compare pages in the pairs (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 5), (5,
6), and so on, to (12, 13).

A couple of example PDF files are provided so that you can try it out.
PDF files can be loaded from the GUI (by pressing the File #1 and File #2
buttons), or by specifying them on the command line. More information is
available in the program's tooltips.


Compiling and Installing DiffPDF
================================

Prerequisites: A C++ compiler that supports tr1, the Qt4 libraries, and
the Poppler libraries (including the Qt4 headers).

1. Unpack the archive file, diffpdf-XXX.tar.gz
2. Change directory to diffpdf-XXX
3. Run qmake # On some systems, e.g., Fedora or Ubuntu, run qmake-qt4
4. Run make
5. Copy diffpdf to somewhere on your PATH

That's it!


Running DiffPDF
===============

A pair of tiny example files are available:
http://www.qtrac.eu/boson1.pdf and http://www.qtrac.eu/boson2.pdf. You
can use these to see the difference between textual and visual
comparisons and to get a feel for how DiffPDF works.

If you hit a bug, please report it to mark@qtrac.eu. Be sure to include
"DiffPDF" in the subject line and specify the version you are using
and details of your system, e.g., operating system name and version,
compiler name and version, Qt library version, Poppler library version.
