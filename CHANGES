1.1.4

Improved the reporting of files that are the same.

1.1.3

Tiny bugfix for Debian.

1.1.2

It is now possible for the user to control whether highlighting is
combined in text mode.

Added a cache for page images. This makes it much quicker to flick back
and forth between pages. The cache size can be set by the user: the
bigger the cache the more pages that can be flicked through without
recalculating.

1.1.1

Replaced QVariant::toReal() with QVariant::toDouble() to avoid breaking
compatibility with Qt 4.4.

1.1.0

Added margin rules to indicate where changes are. (These can be turned
off by setting a rule width of 0.0.)

1.0.0

Implemented the sequence matcher algorithm for text mode matching.

0.6.0

Redid the user interface to use dock widgets.

0.5.0

First release.
