.SH SYNOPSIS
.B diffpdf

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page very briefly documents the \fBdiffpdf\fP command.
.PP
\fBDiffPDF\fP is a GUI application used to compare two PDF files.
.br
By default the comparison is of the text on each pair of pages, but
comparing the visual appearance of pages is also supported (for example,
if a diagram is changed or if a paragraph is reformatted). It is also
possible to compare particular pages or page ranges. For example, if
there are two versions of a PDF file, one with pages 1-12 and the other
with pages 1-13 because of an extra page having been added as page 4,
they can be compared by specifying two page ranges, 1-12 for the first
and 1-3, 5-13 for the second. This will make DiffPDF compare pages in
the pairs (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 5), (5, 6), and so on, to (12,
13).
